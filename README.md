### **Normal Mode: ≽^•˕•^≼**

##### **About Rounds:**
At the start of each game, both players decide the order to play.  
- $${\color{#9370db}The\space player\space going\space first}$$ receives 3 cards.  
- $${\color{#9370db}The\space player\space going\space second}$$ receives also 3 cards.  
Players alternate turns, and each round, they can choose to either $${\color{#9370db}[Play]}$$ a card or $${\color{#9370db}[Draw]}$$ a card.  
When all 9 cups^ are filled with kitties, the player with $${\color{#9370db}more\space points\space wins\space the\space game}$$.

##### **About Cards:**
There are $${\color{#9370db}4\space colors\space of\space cards}$$ and $${\color{#9370db}5\space colors\space of\space cups}$$, including the $${\color{#9370db}white\space cup}$$.
- There are the ACE and Bomb cards.
  - The ace card freezses the enemy! More rounds for you!
  - If you get the bomb card, consider yourslef lucky since its the best!
  Most points and it destry the enemy's card AND let you play again. If you dont win that round it's on you.
  

##### **About Points:**
- You can put your cards in any unoccupied cups.  
- Place kitties in the cups and score points based on the cup color.
- **Matched Cup** (kitty color matches cup color) gives $${\color{#9370db}double\space points}$$.  
- **White Cup** gives $${\color{#9370db}standard\space points}$$.  
- **Unmatched Cup** (kitty color doesn’t match the cup color) gives $${\color{#9370db}no\space points}$$.

##### **About the card placement:**
- Careful where you place your card! if you place it in the wrong cell the cat will destroy it! Your turn will be cancled.
  
##### **About the winner:**
- The one with most Points will win.
- If you get the $${\color{#9370db}ACE}$$, you are lucky! you will be able to freeze your enemy! Although it might only give you one point, but a win is a win! 


- Other modes to be added in the future (ahem Semester 5)
