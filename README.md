### **Normal Mode: ≽^•˕•^≼**

##### **About Rounds:**
At the start of each game, both players decide the order to play.  
- $${\color{#9370db}The\space player\space going\space first}$$ receives 3 cards.  
- $${\color{#9370db}The\space player\space going\space second}$$ receives also 3 cards.  
Players alternate turns, and each round, they can choose to either $${\color{#9370db}[Play]}$$ a card or $${\color{#9370db}[Draw]}$$ a card.  
When all 9 cups^ are filled with kitties, the player with $${\color{#9370db}more\space points\space wins\space the\space game}$$.

##### **About Cards:**
There are $${\color{#9370db}4\space colors\space of\space cards}$$ and $${\color{#9370db}5\space colors\space of\space cups}$$, including the $${\color{#9370db}white\space cup}$$.

##### **About Points:**
- You can put your cards in any unoccupied cups.  
- Place kitties in the cups and score points based on the cup color.
- **Matched Cup** (kitty color matches cup color) gives $${\color{#9370db}double\space points}$$.  
- **White Cup** gives $${\color{#9370db}standard\space points}$$.  
- **Unmatched Cup** (kitty color doesn’t match the cup color) gives $${\color{#9370db}no\space points}$$.

##### **About the card placement:**
- Careful where you place your card! if you place it in the wrong cell the cat will destroy it! Your turn will be cancled.
  
##### **About the winner:**
- The one with most Points will win.
- If you get the $${\color{#9370db}ACE}$$, you are lucky! you will be able to freeze your enemy! Although it might only give you one point, but a win is a win! 


- Other modes to be added in the future (ahem Semester 5)
