### **Normal Mode: ≽^•˕•^≼**

##### **About Rounds:**
At the start of each game, both players decide the order to play.  
- $${\color{#9370db}The\space player\space going\space first}$$ receives 2 cards.  
- $${\color{#9370db}The\space player\space going\space second}$$ receives 3 cards.  
Players alternate turns, and each round, they can choose to either $${\color{#9370db}[Play]}$$ a card or $${\color{#9370db}[Draw]}$$ a card.  
When all 8 cups are filled with kitties, the player with $${\color{#9370db}more\space points\space wins\space the\space game}$$.

##### **About Cards:**
There are $${\color{#9370db}4\space colors\space of\space cards}$$ and $${\color{#9370db}5\space colors\space of\space cups}$$, including the $${\color{#9370db}white\space cup}$$.

##### **About Points:**
- You can put your cards in any unoccupied cups.  
- Place kitties in the cups and score points based on the cup color.
- **Matched Cup** (kitty color matches cup color) gives $${\color{#9370db}double\space points}$$.  
- **White Cup** gives $${\color{#9370db}standard\space points}$$.  
- **Unmatched Cup** (kitty color doesn’t match the cup color) gives $${\color{#9370db}no\space points}$$.

### **Advanced Mode: ฅ^-˕-^ฅ**

##### **Starting Phase:**
At the start of the game:  
- $${\color{#9370db}The\space player\space going\space first}$$ gets 2 Number Cards + 1 Assist Card.  
- $${\color{#9370db}The\space player\space going\space second}$$ gets 3 Number Cards + 1 Assist Card.  
At the start of each round, players receive $${\color{#9370db}1\space additional\space Assist\space Card}$$ from the dealer.

##### **Round Phase:**
The advanced mode is divided into two phases:  
- $${\color{#9370db}Assist\space Card\space Phase}$$  
- $${\color{#9370db}Number\space Card\space Phase}$$  

During each round, players must first deal with Assist Cards, then proceed to the Number Card Phase.  
When all 8 cups are filled with kitties, the $${\color{#9370db}player\space with\space more\space points}$$ wins the game.

##### 🂡 **Assist Card Phase:** 🂡
At the $${\color{#9370db}start\space of\space each\space round}$$, deal with your Assist Cards first.  
There is no limit to how many Assist Cards you can play in a round. Tap $${\color{#9370db}END}$$ to move to the next phase.  
If you're out of Assist Cards or can't play any, the Assist Card Phase ends.

#####  🃁🂭🂺 **Number Card Phase:** 🃜🃚🃖
After the Assist Card Phase, the $${\color{#9370db}Number\space Card\space Phase}$$ begins.  
You can either play a card or draw a card, then the phase ends.

##### **model.cards.Hand Limit:**
You can hold up to $${\color{#9370db}10\space cards}$$ in your hand, including both Assist and Number Cards (same rule applies to normal mode)
