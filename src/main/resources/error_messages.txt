"Is it that hard..? something your wife told me last night."
"Oops! It looks like your brain went on vacation without you."
"That move was about as useful as me coming to the Vorlesung to learn (I sleep in)."
"Well, that was wrong. But at least you tried! Sort of."
"You missed. Kind of like your dating life. Try again!"
"Wrong command! Were you even trying?"
"Wrong hole- i mean Command. Try again!"
"Oh no! Looks like you broke the unbreakable… congrats?"
"Wrong move. Maybe go back to the tutorial?"
"That was a nice try... if you're into failing!"
"Come on... Its not that hard... something your wife said to you last night."
"Syntax matters, buddy. Just like your ex said about communication."
"Uh-oh! Your keyboard's playing hide and seek with the right syntax."
"Maybe if you turn the screen upside down, this will look correct."
"You were so close! Just 1000% off."
"Wrong input. Somewhere, a programmer is laughing."
"Please enter something that makes actual sense this time."
"Wrong input! Did you just slap the keyboard in frustration?"
"Better luck next time… if there is one."
"I’d give you points for creativity, but nope. Still wrong."
"It seems you're typing random words. Have you tried reading the rules?"
"Error 404: The logic in your move could not be found."
"If there was a high score for wrong moves, you'd be winning. I should add that variable soon."
"Oops! That was a misfire. Guess you weren't aiming."
"You really missed the mark on that one. But hey, optimism!"
"Nope, nope, and nope again. At least you're consistent!"
"What was that? Was that even a word?"
"Close, but no cigar. Try a different dictionary next time."
"Syntax error detected! Don't quit your day job."
"Ouch! If only you could blame autocorrect."
"That was a beautiful attempt... if beauty meant absolutely nothing."
